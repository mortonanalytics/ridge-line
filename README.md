## Ridge Line Chart Test Project

This repo is for a test project to add functionality to the existing open source code for the ridge line chart in the `myIO` project.

Please clone this repo and serve the `index.html` page on the web server of your choice to see the example (tested with `http-server` from Node JS).

### Ignore the following

Ignore the lack of axis and labels - they've already been written.

### Add the following to addRidgeLines.js

- animation to the new ridges

- tool tip/mouseover effect for each data point in the `msg` data object that produces a circle at that point on each line (x-axis placement should always be the same, y-axis placement is unique to each ridge line). Tool tip should track mouse placement.

Feel free to amend main.js with suggestions or stuff that makes your life easier, but the idea is primarily to update the `addRidgeLines` function only.

## Next steps

- provide an estimate to Ryan Morton, morton@myMA.us. If agreed, offer will be provided over Gusto
