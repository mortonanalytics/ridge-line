## Ridge Line Chart Test Project

This repo is for a test project to add functionality to the existing open source code for the ridge line chart in the `myIO` project.

Please clone this repo and serve the `index.html` page on the web server of your choice to see the example.

### Ignore the following

Ignore the lack of axis and labels - they've already been written.

### Add the following

- animation to the new ridges

- tool tip/mouseover effect for each data point in the `msg` data object that produces a circle at that point on each line (x-axis placement should always be the same, y-axis placement is unique to each ridge line). Tool tip should track mouse placement.

## Next steps

- provide an estimate to Ryan Morton, morton@myMA.us. If agreed, offer will be provided over Gusto
